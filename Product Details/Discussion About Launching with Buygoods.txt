Yes, the payout is 65% on the front end and 40% on the back end.
The standard CPA is $120, and the offer is public.

For trusted publishers with high AOV and clean traffic, we can increase the payout to $130–$140.


For top and trusted publishers, you may share both TSLs (Main TSL + 2nd TSL) for both offers.
If you are in contact with any top publishers or email-focused publishers, please connect them with us, and we can share additional details directly.

The 2nd TSL for both offers is a long text page, which is performing extremely well on Google and Facebook.
The provided sheets include email swipes, Google keywords, and detailed targeting information.
These long-text TSL pages tend to perform very well for publishers and help drive strong AOV. If a publisher maintains a good AOV, we are open to increasing payouts further.

For new or non-trusted publishers, please offer revenue share only.
If a higher CPA is requested for any publisher, please confirm once with me or @HummaIqbalCPA  before finalizing, to avoid any issues later.
